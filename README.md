## Cloud computing

Cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the internet instead of your computer's hard drive.

Users access cloud services either through a browser or through an app, connecting to the cloud over the internet.

### SaaS (Software as a service)

Insted of users installing an application on their device, **SaaS** applications are hosted on cloud servers, and users can access them over the internet.

Saas applications:

- Salesforce
- MailChimp
- Slack

### PaaS (Platform as a service)

In this model, companies don't pay for hosted applications, instead they pay for things they need to build their own applications.

PaaS vendors offer everything necessary for building an application, including development tools, infrastructure and operating systems over the Internet.

- Heroku
- Microsoft Azure


### IaaS (Infrastructure as a service)

In this model, a company rents the servers and storage they need from a cloud provider. They then use the cloud infrastructure to build their applications.

IaaS providers:
- Digital Ocean
- Google Compute Engine
- OpenStack

Formerly, SaaS, PaaS and IaaS were the three main models of cloud computing, and essentially all cloud services fit into one of these categories. However, in recent years a fourth model has emerged:

### FaaS (Function as a service)

Also known as serverless computing, breaks cloud applications down into even smalled componenets that only run when they are needed.

FaaS or serverless applications still run on servers, as do all these models of cloud computing. But they are called "serverless" because they do not run on dedicated machines, and because the companies building the applications do not have to manage any servers.
