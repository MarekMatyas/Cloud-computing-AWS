# S3 buckets

An Amazon S3 bucket is a public cloud storage resource available in Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3), an object storage offering.

Amazon S3 buckets, which are similar to file, folders, store objects, which constist of data and its descriptive metadata. 

---

### Why to use S3 buckets

It enables fast, easy and secure transfer of a file over the long distance between client and S3 bucket. 

Customers of all sizes and industries can use Amazon S3 to store and protet any amount of data, for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications , backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices(Internet of Things) and big data analytics.

---

### Benefits

Low cost: S3 lets you store data in a range of "storage classes". These classes are based on the frequency and immediacy you require in accessing files.

Scalability: S3 changes you only for what resoures you actually use, and there are no hidden fees or overrage charges.

### DR (Disaster recovery)

Amazon S3 offers several disaster recovery options such as data replication, versioning, lifecycle policies, object lock, and backup/restore tools. These features ensure that your data is highly available, durable, and recoverable in case of a disaster. Regular testing of your disaster recovery plan is also recommended.

### Use cases


1. Amazon S3 is a highly scalable and durable object storage service that can be used for a wide range of use cases, including:

2. Backup and Recovery: S3 can be used to store backups of critical data and applications, making it easy to recover from disasters and avoid data loss.

3. Data Archiving: S3 is an ideal platform for long-term data archiving due to its low cost and high durability. Data can be stored for years or even decades in S3 without incurring high storage costs.

4. Content Delivery: S3 can be used to store and deliver large multimedia files such as images, videos, and audio files, providing high-performance and low-latency access to content.

5. Big Data Analytics: S3 can be used to store large datasets for big data analytics and machine learning, providing a scalable and cost-effective storage solution.

6. Website Hosting: S3 can be used to host static websites by serving HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files directly from S3, providing a highly available and scalable solution.

7. Disaster Recovery: S3 can be used as a disaster recovery solution, allowing organizations to replicate their data across multiple regions to ensure that it's always available even in the event of a disaster.

8. Application Hosting: S3 can be used to host and deliver application files such as binaries, scripts, and executables, providing a scalable and durable solution for hosting applications.

### High availability

Amazon S3 achieves high availability through its distributed architecture and data replication across multiple Availability Zones within a region. Each object stored in S3 is automatically replicated to multiple servers within an Availability Zone, providing redundancy and high availability.

### Social media


- Social media platforms use Amazon S3 for storing and serving user-generated content such as photos, videos, and posts.

- S3 provides unlimited storage capacity and is highly scalable, allowing social media platforms to store and serve a massive amount of content.

- S3 is integrated with Amazon CloudFront for low-latency content delivery.

- S3 is used for backup and recovery of critical data.

- S3 is used for big data analytics and machine learning to analyze user behavior and preferences.

### CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete)


Are the 4 basic operations that can be performed on data in most software systems or applications.

These operations represent the basic functionalities that allow users to interact with databse or application.

- Create: This operation allows users to add new data to the system or database.

- Read: This operation allows users to retrieve data from the system or database.

- Update: This operation allows users to modify or update existing data in the system or database.

- Delete: This operation allows users to remove data from the system or database.


CRUD is a fundamental concept in software development and is used in many applications and systems. It provides a simple and intuitive way for users to interact with data, and it forms the basis of many software architectures and frameworks.



# Creating a bucket

---
In this case we will use S3 as a DR(Distaster Recovery) to ensure our files are safe.

---
First things first we need to have a file with access key and secret access key and move that file into our `.ssh` folder and lastly, `ssh` into our newly created instance. 


We need to navigate into S3 section from the EC2 dashboard. 

- In our GitBash terminal after connecting to the instance we need to run `sudo apt update -y` to run updates and check the internet connection following with `sudo apt upgrade -y`.

- We need to install the appropriate version of python `python --version`, for the aws command line. Python 3.6.9 and above is required. 

- `alias python=python3`(in future we have to make this persistent) followed by `sudo apt install python -y` to install the appropriate version, and check the version again `python --version`

- `sudo apt install python3-pip` We need to install the pip package manager

- `sudo pip3 install awscli` to install aws command line using pip3 package manager

- `aws configure` to input the access key and secret key, then which region `eu-west-1` and lastly, output:`json`

- To double check we run `aws configure`, if the configuration has been inputed we only press enter.

- `aws s3 ls` to see what is available in the bucket. 

- `aws s3 mb s3://marek-tech201` (mb stands for make bucket) after // is what we want to name the bucket. This command makes the bucket (folder).

- Then we can check in AWS console/buckets if it has been created. If we would like we can upload object and it creates URL using AWS console. 

- Now that the bucket is created we would like to store data in that bucket. `sudo touch test.txt` for the training purposes. To check if it has been created `ls`

- `sudo nano test.txt` to edit the file 

- We can insert any text to see if it will transfer into our bucket

- `cat test.txt` to see the changes 

- Now we want to upload that file `aws s3 cp test.txt s3://<name of the bucket>`

- We can go back to our AWS console and refresh the page to see if the folder has been uploaded into our bucket

- After that we will need to change permissions in case if the access is denied

- In the AWS console inside our folder we move onto permissions section and grant desired permissions in `edit` section and `save changes`

- Click on the URL if we can see the content we edited in the `test.txt`
